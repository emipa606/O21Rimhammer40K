Update of Neronix17s mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1513943591
with their permission

Neronix17 is currently working on a reworked version of this mod that is scheduled to be released in the summer of 2021

- The story-framework the original mod used is not updated yet, so that part is disabled for now
- Since some parts of the mod depended on removed features they had to be remade, hopfully without errors
- I have personally no experience with the Warhammer 40K universe so any questions regarding the lore I leave to the fans to answer
