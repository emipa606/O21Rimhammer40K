If you googled this thinking you can be clever and get the non-steam download and are now suffering a massive list of errors, don't expect help. Follow the Discord instructions after accepting the rules and opting into the Rimhammer 40k channels/announcements using the #passport channel like a good little leech.

* Rikiki - [MiningCo. Projectors, Mining Helmets and Spaceships.](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=14711.0) - Integrated so they aren't a dependancy, but will work perfectly fine alongside Rimhammer 40k and are well worth using.
